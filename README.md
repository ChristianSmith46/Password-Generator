# Password Generator - Module 3
In this module we were tasked with creating a password generator that could take some requirements and return a password to the user that fits said requirements.  The password needed to be between 8-128 characters, and have options of including lowercase, uppercase, number and/or special characters.  We had the option of displaying on the page or giving an alert, but I chose to display it on the page.
